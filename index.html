    Sometimes, all I wonder is how your heart works. Does it beat for me? Can I dance to the beat? Baby, all of me is falling for you. Will you hold me? All I need is a yes from you. What is required is your acceptance. In you, I find comfort and happiness while I face the challenges life presents to me. Your presence makes me feel alive and I am loving every bit of it.

    <img src="love2.jpg" alt="Heart" width="470" height="350">
    Listening to your voice blows my heart away. It makes me feel better than I have ever felt. Your love has created a path for me. Sometimes, I wonder how I would have made it this far without you and your love. You have made me feel so much fulfillment and happiness that my poor heart has never consumed. I am grateful for your unconditional love that never runs dry.

    You came into my life just when my world needed you dearly. You showed up that hour when I needed you badly. What a fantastic person I have as my lover. There are no words to describe you, my darling because you are everything I need in a partner and more. Our journey of love is like a pilgrimage spiced with happiness, love, and care. I cannot thank God enough for sending you my way because you are a bundle of blessing I cherish every day.

    With you, all my dreams have become a reality. You are the change I needed to survive through lifes troubles. I have you to myself, and I will do anything to keep you in my world forever. Your home is my heart, and I will nurture you like a royalty that you are. I love you, babe, with all my heart, and nothing compares with you in any way.

    You are no doubt the best thing that ever happened to me. I am so blessed that I finally found the missing part of me. Loving you has opened me to see the world in a different dimension. Now, I have realized how beautiful life can be, only when you are with the one that makes your heart ring. Your love is the energizer that I need to keep living. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for us. I already know it will be beautiful.
